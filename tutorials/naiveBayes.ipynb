The README in the /pubmed folder contains the necessary scripts to download the Pubmed dataset in XML format and parse each article. It is recommended to parse around 500 files and just their body introductions for simplicity and time. Finally, the README in the /summarization/pubmed_summarization describes how to train the Naive Bayes model for summarization on the parsed Pubmed articles."

Patient with significant warmth and\n   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with\n   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following\n   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and\n   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given\n   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of\n   fever/cellulitis.  CXR without evidence of PNA, likely atelectasis at\n   LLL.\n   - Continue Vanc, cefepime\n   - d/c levo\n   - Follow-up blood cultures\n currently negative\n   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site\n GM stain GPC/GNR\n   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis\n   - follow fever curve.  Remains afebrile\n   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:\n   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in\n   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear\n   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;\n   however, will continue to monitor.  BP stable while in MICU.\n   - IVF boluses as needed\n   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen\n   # VT code:\n   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code\n   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after\n   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and\n   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to\n   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK\n   continued trend downward since admission.\n   - Cardiology consult\n   - Echo today\n   - Cont telemetry\n   #  Hypernatremia:\n   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO\n   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS\n   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for\n   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia\n   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.\n   - Free water flushes through PEG\n   - cont daily electrolytes check\n   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:\n   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen\n   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound\n   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.  Creatinine\n   trended downward to normal over course of rehydration.\n   - Follow-up Cr with ongoing hydration via PEG and daily electrolytes\n   checks\n   # Hyperglycemia:\n   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in\n   setting of infection.  Taken off insulin gtt without complications.\n   FSBG trending into acceptable range in sliding scale and lantus.\n   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U\n   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.\n   - QID fingersticks\n   #  AMS:\n   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p\n   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT\n   showed no acute process.  Mental status improved over course of MICU\n   stay with hydration and treatment of infection.\n   - Continue donepezil\n   - vanco/cefepime for infection\n   # Hypocalcemia:\n   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.  Remained stable without issues\n   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes\n   #  Thrombocytopenia:\n   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93\n   this AM, stable in 90\ns. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.\n   - Follow-up peripheral smear\n   - Cont to follow plts.  Unlikely DIC at this point.\n   # Anemia:\n   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not\n   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).\n   - Trend HCT, stable\n   - Guiaic stools\n   # Troponin leak:\n   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for\n   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting\n   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was\n   0.05 this AM.\n   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI\n   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:\n   - Wound care via nursing\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren 2.0 (Full) - [**2115-3-25**] 07:13 PM 40 mL/hour.
